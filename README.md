# Project Noodles Password Vault

This is the main repository for the password vault, written by the Noodles team in CS 188 Winter '20.

## Structure

The repository is broken down into three main components:
    1. A directory containing python code for the HTTP server that sits behind an HSTS Elastic Beanstalk setup, along with its database access.
    2. A directory containing the python and c code for the client application.
    3. A directory containing the javascript code for the Chrome extension.
    
Each repository contains the main code along with a testing directory that contains smoke tests for the code.

## Milestones

Below are the projected milestones for code completion on the project.

    - End of Week 4: Git repository set up, initial commits of skeleton code
    - End of Week 5: Code working in tests without integration with other parts, unit testing
    - End of Week 6: Code integration between parts, integration testing
    - End of Week 7: Project demo, code finished with major bugs fleshed out
